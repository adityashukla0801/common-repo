# Common Repository for UI Components, Utilities, and Business Logic

## Overview

This repository provides reusable UI components, utility functions, and business logic to be shared across multiple web projects. It aims to standardize and streamline development by promoting reusability, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

## 1. Architecture Proposal

### Objective:

The goal of this architecture is to create a centralized repository for shared UI components, utility functions, and business logic. This will enhance code reuse and consistency across different projects.

### Key Principles:

- **Modularity**: Separation of UI, utilities, and business logic.
- **Scalability**: The architecture can scale as new components and features are added.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensures the repository is clean and easy to maintain by keeping UI, utilities, and business logic independent.
- **Reusability**: Components and logic are designed to be reused across projects.

### Layers:

1. **UI Components**: Reusable React components (e.g., buttons, modals).
2. **Utility Functions**: Common logic (e.g., formatting, API helpers).
3. **Business Logic**: Application-specific logic (e.g., validation, state management).

### Technologies:

- **React 18**: For reusable UI components.
- **Context API/Redux**: For shared state management, if necessary.
- **Jest/Testing Library**: For unit tests and component testing.

## 2. Folder Structure

Here is the proposed folder structure demonstrating separation of concerns:
